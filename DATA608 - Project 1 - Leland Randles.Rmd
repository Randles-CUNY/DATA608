**Principles of Data Visualization and Introduction to ggplot2**

I have provided you with data about the 5,000 fastest growing companies in the US, as compiled by Inc. magazine. lets read this in:

```{r}
inc <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charleyferrari/CUNY_DATA_608/master/module1/Data/inc5000_data.csv", header= TRUE)
```

And lets preview this data:

```{r}
head(inc)
summary(inc)
```

Think a bit on what these summaries mean. Use the space below to add some more relevant non-visual exploratory information you think helps you understand this data:

```{r}
# I think the summary gives us nearly all the info we need, but I like
# to examine the data closer to get into the specifics of the data
# For example, I like to check the number of rows in the df
nrow(inc)
# We can see there are 5,001 rows despite the data set being described 
# as the top 5,000 fastest growing companies. s a first step towards 
# figuring out why, I looked at the final rows of the dataframe:
tail(inc)
# We can see there are two companies ranked 5,000, hence 5,001 rows. I also 
# like to study some of the specific columns to get a deeper understanding 
# of each column, i.e., how many state codes are there in the data set? 
unique(unlist(inc$State))
# We see 52 codes, the 50 states plus DC and Puerto Rico. Next I check the
# Industry column to see how many they are there and if they're duplicative.
unique(unlist(inc$Industry))
# We see 25 different industry categories and none of them overlap.
# For the numerical columns Growth_Rate, Revenue and Employees, I like to
# do some binning to get a feel for how skewed they are. I could already 
# discern skew from the summary function and would usually explore this via
# plots, but the assignment asks for non-visual exploratory information.
# First, the bins for Growth_Rate:
br_gr = seq(min(inc$Growth_Rate),max(inc$Growth_Rate),by=(max(inc$Growth_Rate) - min(inc$Growth_Rate))/10)
ranges_gr = paste(head(br_gr,-1), br_gr[-1], sep=" - ")
freq_gr = hist(inc$Growth_Rate, breaks=br_gr, include.lowest=TRUE, plot=FALSE)
data.frame(range = ranges_gr, frequency = freq_gr$counts)
# We see that the extraordinary majority of growth rates are 42.454% or lower
# Second, the bins for Revenue:
br_rev = seq(min(inc$Revenue),max(inc$Revenue),by=(max(inc$Revenue) - min(inc$Revenue))/10)
ranges_rev = paste(head(br_rev,-1), br_rev[-1], sep=" - ")
freq_rev = hist(inc$Revenue, breaks=br_rev, include.lowest=TRUE, plot=FALSE)
data.frame(range = ranges_rev, frequency = freq_rev$counts)
# Again, we see the overwhelming majority of Revenue amts in the lowest bin
# Lastly, the bins for number of employees:
br_emp = seq(min(inc$Employees[!is.na(inc$Employees)]),max(inc$Employees[!is.na(inc$Employees)]),by=(max(inc$Employees[!is.na(inc$Employees)]) - min(inc$Employees[!is.na(inc$Employees)]))/10)
ranges_emp = paste(head(br_emp,-1), br_emp[-1], sep=" - ")
freq_emp = hist(inc$Employees, breaks=br_emp, include.lowest=TRUE, plot=FALSE)
data.frame(range = ranges_emp, frequency = freq_emp$counts)
# Again, the overwhelming majority of employee counts are in the 1st bin
```

## Question 1

Create a graph that shows the distribution of companies in the dataset by State (ie how many are in each state). There are a lot of States, so consider which axis you should use. This visualization is ultimately going to be consumed on a 'portrait' oriented screen (ie taller than wide), which should further guide your layout choices.

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2", repos='https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/')
library(ggplot2)
install.packages("forcats", repos='https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/')
library(forcats)
```

```{r}
g <- ggplot(inc, aes(State))
g + geom_bar(aes(fct_infreq(factor(State)), fill=State), position = position_stack(reverse = TRUE), show.legend = F) + coord_flip() + ylab("Number of Companies in Top 5,000") + ggtitle("5,000 Fastest Growing Companies - Count by State")
```

## Question 2

Lets dig in on the state with the 3rd most companies in the data set. Imagine you work for the state and are interested in how many people are employed by companies in different industries. Create a plot that shows the average and/or median employment by industry for companies in this state (only use cases with full data, use R's `complete.cases()` function.) In addition to this, your graph should show how variable the ranges are, and you should deal with outliers.

```{r}
inc_ny <- subset(inc,State=="NY")
p <- ggplot(inc_ny, aes(inc_ny$Industry, inc_ny$Employees))
p + geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) + ylim(0,1000) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

## Question 3

Now imagine you work for an investor and want to see which industries generate the most revenue per employee. Create a chart that makes this information clear. Once again, the distribution per industry should be shown.

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr", repos='https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/')
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
industries <- group_by(inc_ny, Industry)
inc_ny_sum <- summarize(industries, rev_per_employees = sum(Revenue)/sum(Employees))
r <- ggplot(inc_ny_sum, aes(inc_ny_sum$Industry, inc_ny_sum$rev_per_employees))
r + geom_point() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + xlab("Industry") + ylab("Revenue per Employee")
```
